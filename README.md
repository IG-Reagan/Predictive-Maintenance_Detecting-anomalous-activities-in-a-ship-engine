# Predictive-Maintenance_Detecting-anomalous-activities-in-a-ship-engine
This project developed a machine-learning-based predictive maintenance framework to detect anomalous behaviour in ship engine performance. The goal was to identify early warning signs of mechanical faults to reduce downtime, improve safety, and optimise operational efficiency across a commercial shipping fleet.
